    <h1>Why is the problem important?</h1>
      <p>In most developing countries for instance South - Sudan the schools and the students do not have the means to afford school supplies such as papers, pens, notebooks, back packs. 
        Studying without school supplies makes it difficult for students to learn and many students do not attend class because of the bad learning experience. 
        This generally decreases the learning outcome and the motivation of the students and cases other social economic problems.
