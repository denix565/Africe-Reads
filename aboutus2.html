        <h2>Why is the problem important?</h2>
        <p>Our idea is helping to advance the <a class="onHoverChangeSize", href = "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-04/">UN sustainble goal - Quality education.</a></p>
          <p>In most developing countries for instance South - Sudan the schools and the students do not have the means to afford school supplies such as papers, pens, notebooks, back packs.
            Studying without school supplies makes it difficult for students to learn and many students do not attend class because of the bad learning experience.
            This generally decreases the learning outcome and the motivation of the students and cases other social economic problems.

      <p>At the drop off locations you will find secured drop off boxes to donate your schools supplies. </p><br>
        <img src="pics/donationbox.png" class ="boxIMG" alt="Donation Box">
      <p>Schools, individuals and companies are encouraged to donate.
        Every end of studying semester we start our collection for the selected country. The container is marked with a sticker explaining where the supplies will go and how they will be used. There is also information describing the problems of the country with education and the need for the basic school supplies.
        Once the donation period is over a team of volunteers picks up the supplies and delver them to the sorting center.  At the center we access and sort the delivered supplies according to age group and usability. The supplies that are too damaged will be recycled.
        Notebooks, backpacks, rulers and other supplies will be sorted according to age group and usability.
        The transportation is facilitated by an agreement with Unicef, united natios and the local authorities.
        The supplies can be delivered directly to the government of the country for distribution,
        or to humanitarian organizations on the ground such as the Read Cross.</p>

        <h2>What is our solution?</h2>
          <p>
            Our solution is to establish a network of dop off locations for donations of schools supplies such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Bagpack</li>
              <li>Notebooks</li>
              <li>Pens</li>
              <li>Calculators</li>
              <li>Rulers</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
